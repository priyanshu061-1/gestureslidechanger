Step-by-Step Implementation:
Import Required Libraries:

OpenCV for capturing video from the webcam.
Mediapipe for hand tracking and gesture recognition.
PyAutoGUI for simulating keyboard actions (like left and right arrow key presses to change slides).
Create a Gesture Recognition Program:

Use MediaPipe to detect hands and specific gestures (like swiping left or right).
Use PyAutoGUI to simulate key presses based on the detected gestures.
Explanation:
MediaPipe: Detects hands and landmarks, allowing gesture recognition.
PyAutoGUI: Simulates keyboard presses to change slides.
Gesture Detection: Compares the x-coordinates of thumb and index finger tips to detect swipes.
Usage:
Run the script and make sure your webcam is active.
Swipe your hand left or right in front of the camera to change slides.
Press 'q' to exit the application.
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular library in Python used for image processing, computer vision, and machine learning tasks. It provides a comprehensive set of functions and tools to work with images and videos.

Key Features of OpenCV:
Real-time image processing.
Face, object, and motion detection.
Edge detection, contour finding, and image transformation.
Integration with other libraries like NumPy and SciPy.
